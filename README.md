This repository contains the work on the topic Interactive exploration and visualisation.


In this paper, we presented the case for a new bread of data management systems which seek to maximize human productivity by allowing users to rapidly gain insights from new large datasets. We outlined the research challenges and opportunities when building such a new system and discussed the insights we gained from building our system called IDEA. Finally, we discussed other important considerations in the context of building interactive data exploration systems including benchmarking, natural language interfaces, as well as interactive  machine learning.
